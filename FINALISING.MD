Sprint 7: Complete Brain Model Integration ✅ COMPLETED!
✅ All Tasks Done:
1. GGUF Model Loading Infrastructure ✅
   - GGUFModelLoader class with caching and error handling
   - Model warm-up and CPU optimization
   - All 3 models (Phi-3.1, TinyLlama, Llama-3.2) working

2. Complete Brain Agents ✅
   - Prefrontal Cortex Agent: Phi-3.1 for complex reasoning/planning
   - Amygdala Agent: TinyLlama for personality/emotion
   - Hippocampus Agent: Llama-3.2 for intelligent memory operations

3. Thalamus Router ✅
   - Query complexity analysis and routing
   - Model selection logic (simple → personality, complex → reasoning)
   - Performance optimization and token estimation

4. Orchestrator Integration ✅
   - Multi-model inference coordination
   - Intelligent agent routing based on query type
   - Error handling and fallback logic

5. Testing & Validation ✅
   - All agents tested individually ✅
   - Multi-model conversations working ✅
   - Memory ingestion with AI summarization ✅
   - Performance benchmarking completed ✅

What We Now Have:
🧠 Real AI Models: Phi-3.1, TinyLlama, Llama-3.2 running inference
